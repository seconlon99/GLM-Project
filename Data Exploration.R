## Results:
## The deviance residuals for both HA and Age seem to be relatively stable but deviate from 0 in the middle of the curve. Maybe a second order effect or an interaction term would help the model?

# Checking the other model assumptions:
# Cook's distance
plot(model_full, which = 4)  # Cook's distance

# Leverage values
plot(model_full, which = 5)  # Residuals vs Leverage

## Results:
## three outliers: 48 83 and 124 seem to be outliers for the model in both measures.

## overall commentary:
## There is multicollinearity among the predictors. 
## There are some issues with the deviance in the model and the multicollinearity between the predictors requires some kind of fix.
## I suggest fitting new models with these discoveries in mind and then retesting the goodness of fit and model assumptions.
## Perhaps it's also worth exploring the gender effect, but in my opinion I did not think this was significant.

# The flu shot uptake ("Yes") is relatively low.
# This might be an argument in favour of cloglog in our case as it might better
# accommodate the asymmetry in the distribution.

# However, since differences in fit are negligible and we do not have a strong

#Interpretation of Coefficients

# Fit the final logistic regression model
model_logit <- glm(Y ~ HA + Age + Gender, data = data, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# Output model summary
summary(model_logit)

## Model Summary and Interpretation##

# Coefficients and their meaning:
# (Intercept): -1.177 (p = 0.693) Not statistically significant.
# HA: -0.099 (p = 0.003)   Significant, negative effect on flu shot uptake.
# Age: +0.073 (p = 0.017)  Significant, positive effect on flu shot uptake.
# Gender (Male): +0.434 (p = 0.406)  Not statistically significant

# Interpretation of each coefficient:

# 1. Health Awareness (HA):
# A one-unit increase in HA leads to a decrease in the log-odds of getting a flu shot by 0.099.
# The odds ratio is exp(-0.099) â‰ˆ 0.91 , about 9% decrease in odds of vaccination.
# but, since HA is negatively correlated with Age (r = -0.47),
# and younger individuals are less likely to get vaccinated, this effect may be confounded.
# So the HA effect should be interpreted cautiously.

# 2. Age:
# Each additional year of age increases the log-odds of vaccination by 0.073.
# Odds ratio is exp(0.073) â‰ˆ 1.076 â†’ about 7.6% increase in odds per year.
# This result aligns with EDA and common expectations.

# 3. Gender (Male):
# The coefficient is not statistically significant (p = 0.406),
# suggesting gender does not have a meaningful effect on flu shot behavior after adjusting for Age and HA.

##Model Fit Summary##

# Chosen model: logit link logistic regression
# AIC = 113.09 â†’ better than models with interaction/quadratic terms

# Goodness of fit:
# - Hosmerâ€“Lemeshow test: p = 0.458  No significant, lack of fit
# - AUC = 0.822 â†’ Good classification performance
# - Residuals and influence measures show no concerning outliers

## Final Notes ##

# - Age is the most important predictor.
# - HA is statistically significant, but may be confounded by Age.
# - Gender is not a significant predictor.
# - The model is stable and fits the data well.

# --Limitations and Extensions --

# While HA and Age are both statistically significant, their moderate negative correlation (r = -0.47)
# suggests potential multicollinearity. Including both in the model may dilute each other's effect.
# Additionally, the proportion of vaccinated individuals is low in the dataset.
# Finally, although Gender is not significant here, future models could explore gender-specific behaviors
# using interaction terms in larger or more balanced samples.
