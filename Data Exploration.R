## Results: 
## HA and intercept terms are significant
## Null and residual deviance seem to be having some problems.

# 2. Show that age and HA are negatively correlated
## Results: 
## they have a moderate negative correlation of -.47.
## Since older people are more likely to get vaccinated, and they also tend to score lower on HA, 
## itâ€™s possible that HA is not causally reducing vaccine uptake, but instead acting as a proxy for age.
## We you should control for age to assess the true relationship between HA and flu shot status.

## The P value is highly significant giving evidence that there is a seperation in the mean age of those who did and did not get the flu shot

## Results:
## The deviance residuals for both HA and Age seem to be relatively stable but deviate from 0 in the middle of the curve. Maybe a second order effect or an interaction term would help the model?

# Checking the other model assumptions:
# Cook's distance
plot(model_full, which = 4)  # Cook's distance

# Leverage values
plot(model_full, which = 5)  # Residuals vs Leverage

## Results:
## three outliers: 48 83 and 124 seem to be outliers for the model in both measures.

## overall commentary:
## There is multicollinearity among the predictors. 
## There are some issues with the deviance in the model and the multicollinearity between the predictors requires some kind of fix.
## I suggest fitting new models with these discoveries in mind and then retesting the goodness of fit and model assumptions.
## Perhaps it's also worth exploring the gender effect, but in my opinion I did not think this was significant.
